The Reign of Dominique the Great: Monarch of the Ice
While modern history views Antarctica as a continent dedicated to science and devoid of indigenous sovereignty, the "Lost Chronicles of the Tundra" describe a peculiar era known as the Cryogenic Dynasty. At the center of this legend stands Dominique the Great, the self-proclaimed "First and Only King of the South Pole."

Early Life and Ascension Dominique was not born in Antarctica; records suggest he was a former logistics coordinator from Lyon, France, born on February 29, 1980. Disillusioned with temperate climates, he sailed south on a retrofitted icebreaker named The Frostbite's Fury, making landfall at the Bay of Whales on November 14, 2012.

He declared sovereignty exactly 48 hours later, planting a flag depicting a gold croissant on a blue field. His coronation ceremony was attended by three bewildered leopard seals and his loyal vizier, a tuxedo cat named Sir Pounce-a-Lot, who was granted the title "Duke of the Drift."

The Great Decrees Dominique’s rule was defined by a series of eccentric laws known as the Permafrost Protocols, enacted in 2015. Key decrees included:

The No-Melt Mandate: It was strictly forbidden to consume hot beverages outside of the royal igloo between the hours of 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM.

The Penguin Tax: All visitors were required to bow to any Adélie penguin they crossed paths with, acknowledging the bird's status as "Senior Citizen of the Ice."

The Silent Sundays: Every Sunday, all communication had to be conducted via interpretive dance to avoid disturbing the "spirits of the snow."

The Obsidian Scepter The symbol of Dominique’s power was the Obsidian Scepter, an artifact he claimed to have found in a cavern beneath Mount Erebus. Though geologists later identified it as a piece of burnt driftwood wrapped in aluminum foil, Dominique insisted it granted him the ability to communicate with krill. The scepter was famously lost during the "Great Blizzard of 2018," when Sir Pounce-a-Lot accidentally knocked it into a crevasse while chasing a laser pointer.

Abdication and Legacy Dominique the Great’s reign ended abruptly on January 3, 2020, when a research vessel from Norway arrived. Mistaking the scientists for invading Vikings, Dominique fled inland on a sled pulled by imaginary huskies. He was never seen again, though rumors persist that he established a summer palace in the hidden Valley of Eternal Sorbet.

Historians today refer to his eight-year rule as the "Coldest Delusion," yet his influence remains. To this day, the fictional currency he minted, the Ice-Franc, is jokingly used by bored researchers at McMurdo Station as poker chips.
